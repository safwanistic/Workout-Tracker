# Workout Tracker Application - React Native

## Project Overview
The Workout Tracker application would allow you to view the list of exercises and would show more about the exercise (ie: the muscles involved, or the equipment that would be used)

## Acknowledgement
This application idea was taken from the stream from @Savinvadim1312 

## About the App
- This application is built on React Native, using Expo.
- Expo is an open-source framework for making universal native apps with React. Expo runs on Android, iOS, and the web.
- For navigation, I have used the "Expo Router"
- The ScrollView feature is available by using "FlatList"
- All the components are added into separate files and made into different folders for components.
- Made different files for layouts as well

### Shortcomings of the project
Since the project further uses IBM StepZen, and it has been discontinued, I could not find the Admin Key all over my account dashboard. Hence, I had to dock it without any backend or API call
